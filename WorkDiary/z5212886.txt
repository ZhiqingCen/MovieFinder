  - 6PM on 26 June 2022 to 1:30AM on 27 June 2022

I expereienced obstacles this week in communicating with one of the team member, I tried many time to politely ask
him to push his code but he refuses to, the progressive demo A is on 27 June 2022, it was only until I asked multiple 
times and I finally got the dependent backend code from him on 27 June 2022 midnight. Then I can start on testing 
some part of the frontend code. I was very worry about not getting the frontend work as expected, even though I have finish
my part as early as I can, coorperation is very important between frontend and backend, some code can't be fully tested
or even start coding if the dependent backend API is not provided. This has greatly affected my work-life balance and 
my plan of the week, since the relarent backend code was expected to finished by Wednesday and I have planned my whole 
Thursday and Friday for the forntend part, but due to this issue, the whole weekend plan was ruined. Luckily I have tried 
my best and sacrifise sleeping time to successful get the frontend code working as expected before the demo. I should 
raise this issue during the retrospective A meeting to seek for a solution.

Even though the issue of not pushing updated code on time has been discussed during the retrospective A meeting,
